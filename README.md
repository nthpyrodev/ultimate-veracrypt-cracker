It's straight forward to use, just make sure you have Python installed, then wherever there is a comment, you will probably need to edit something such as your wordlist.

The wordlist needs to be formatted with each possible password on a new line.


I will be creating a repo soon with the ultimate wordlist generator for every type. I will link to it here when that's done.
